### Playing the Game
* **Goal**: Reach the water 10 times before losing the allotted 3 lives.
* The player uses the arrow keys to control the player on the game board.
* If the player hits a lady bug, the player loses a life and is reset to the starting position. The player is allotted 3 lives.
* When the player reaches the water, a win is added to the Wins total. The player will reset to the starting position and will attempt another quest to the water.
* The game ends when the player reaches the water 10 times (Victory!) or loses all 3 lives (Defeat).
* A true Lady Bug Warrior takes as few steps as possible in search of the water. Try to keep the move count as low as possible.

### Udacity Instructions for the Game Project
Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.
